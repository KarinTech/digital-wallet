Create Templates:

Create a form template (transfer.html) with input fields for sender, receiver, and amount.
Create a success template (success.html) to display a success message after a successful transfer.
Create an error template (error.html) to display an error message for insufficient balance or any other validation errors.
Please make sure to configure your Django project properly, including database settings and URL routing, before using this code. Additionally, remember to handle edge cases, implement user authentication, and consider security measures to suit your application's requirements.
